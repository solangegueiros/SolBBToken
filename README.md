# Brickblock Assignment
The project is given as an assignment for the blockchain developer recruitment process. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/brickblock-io/coding-challenge-blockchain)


## Brief
The main deliverables of the project were:

1- Publish a token at Ethereum testnet. I chose Ropsten testnet.

2- Create a wallet using React to display the token balance of my ERC20 token for a given Ethereum address.



I created SolBBToken [here](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x3730aa313345f4b00e478a5010c2d3b921555520).

Token address: 0x3730aa313345f4b00e478a5010c2d3b921555520


I did 2 projects:

1- SolBBToken - the project token

2- SolWallet - the wallet developed using React


To get SolBBTokens, just ask.
If you have up to 100 tokens in your wallet, you can ask at SolWallet and will get 10 tokens per order.
